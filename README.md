# TMDB
Database Setup: Use PostgreSQL (already in use with Docker) to store movie data. This includes text data and links to movie posters.

Data Model: Create a data model in your database for movies. This should include fields for all the text data you want to store, a field for the movie poster link, a field to flag whether the poster should be updated, and a timestamp field for the last update.

API Integration: Write code to fetch movie data from the TMDB API. This could be done using a language like JavaScript (Node.js), Python, or Ruby, depending on your existing tech stack.

Data Storage: Write code to store the fetched movie data in your database. This should include setting the last update timestamp.

Data Update: Write code to regularly check TMDB for updates to the movie data. This should use the TMDB's updated timestamps to trigger updates on your side. When updating, check the poster flag field to decide whether to update the poster link.

Caching: Implement a caching system using software like Redis or Memcached. Cache frequently accessed data like popular movies. Set a cache expiry based on how often the data changes.

API Rate Limiting: Ensure your requests to the TMDB API don't exceed their rate limits. This could involve implementing a rate limiting system on your side.

Attribution: According to TMDB's terms, you must give them attribution for their data. This could be a statement in your app like "This product uses the TMDB API but is not endorsed or certified by TMDB."

Privacy and Compliance: If your app involves user data, ensure you're respecting user privacy and complying with relevant laws and regulations.

Testing and Monitoring: Regularly test your system to ensure it's working correctly and efficiently. Monitor your API usage, database performance, and cache performance.
